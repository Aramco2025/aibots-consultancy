# Images Directory

This directory is intended for storing all image assets for your AI Bots Consultancy website.

## Required Images

Based on the sample implementation, you should add the following images to this directory:

1. `jaguar.jpg` - Main hero image of a jaguar (representing speed, intelligence, precision)
2. `jaguar-pattern.jpg` - Close-up of jaguar pattern for background elements
3. `founder.jpg` - Image of the founder for the "Who's The Visionary Behind?" section
4. `favicon.png` - Website favicon/icon

## Image Guidelines

For optimal performance and visual quality:

1. **Optimize all images** before adding them to reduce file size while maintaining quality
   - Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
   - Aim for file sizes under 200KB for most images

2. **Use appropriate dimensions**:
   - Hero images: 1920px × 1080px (or similar 16:9 ratio)
   - Background patterns: 1000px × 1000px
   - Profile/founder images: 600px × 800px
   - Icons: 32px × 32px (favicon)

3. **Use appropriate formats**:
   - Photos: JPG or WebP
   - Graphics with transparency: PNG
   - Simple graphics: SVG when possible
   - Favicon: PNG or ICO

4. **Consider responsive images**:
   - For critical images, consider creating multiple sizes for different devices
   - Example naming convention: `jaguar-large.jpg`, `jaguar-medium.jpg`, `jaguar-small.jpg`
